# DID 
>Dissociative identity disorder (DID), previously known as multiple personality disorder, is a mental disorder characterized by the presence of two or more distinct personality states and dissociative amnesia. These personality states, often referred to as "alters," can exhibit different moods, preferences, and even physical attributes like handedness or allergies. DID is typically associated with severe childhood trauma and abuse, such as rape, violence, neglect, or severe bullying.
