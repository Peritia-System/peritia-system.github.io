# Letter
Hi Baby,
I am writing this rn at work cause when else would I. I am not able to write at home without you noticing, you know me to well.
But I want to make sure you know how much you mean to me.

First and foremost, Happy Birthday, Baby! I hope today is everything you want it to be, one without your mom nagging and annoying you, one without anyone ruining it, one where we do what you want. A day for you my love! 

Though i want to take a moment to say i am sorry. First for not having a Gift. No real gift that is. I have no game i made for you, nor anything material. I wanted to record me singing though never made it. 
I have a something though. A promise. Cause as soon as i can I ll gift you the world. I vow to do my best so there is never a moment where you need to hold back cause of money. 
And Time, today and everyday that follows and i promise to always fill it with love. Love for you. 

Talking about time:
Today marks 19 years since the love of my life was born. 
It also marks:
- **228 months:** Since the most handsome person graced this world.
- **991 weeks:** Since the most loving husband made his way in this Game called life.
- **6940 days:** Since you've been brightening the world, more beautiful every day.
- **166,600 hours:** You've traversed this planet – a journey I'm so lucky to be now part of.
- **9,998,000 minutes:** You've spent on this earth.
- **763,200 minutes:** We've shared together.
- **56,200 minutes:** As friends.
- **707,000 minutes:** As lovers.

And i won't let you spend another without me.
People say time is Precious. Business man say time is money. Doctors say time is crucial. Phillophers say time is an illusion. Albert Einstein said time is relative. 
Kids say time flies just by.  

And I say Time? for once cause i have ADHD. But on the other because i have an Eternity with you. Though even though i have an eternity with you: Forever with you isn't enough time; I wish we had a thousand eternities. No.  Even that isn't enough. If we could have a thousand eternities, it still wouldn't be enough to express the depth of my love to you.

I love you more than words can say, litterally. Words simply can't capture the immensity of my feelings.
Saying "I love you" feels inadequate. It's the same in German: _Ich liebe dich_ – since even in my own language i fall short to articulate it.
Italian and Spanish, languages often associated with romance – _Ti amo_ , _Te amo_ – try their best, but still can't fully express it. Not even French comes with _Je t'aime_ . The language of love itself struggles to do justice to what I feel.
Even Japanese, with its many expressions of affection:  _Ai shiteru_ , _Suki da_ , and _Daisuki dayo_ , fall short of truly conveying the depth of my love for you.

No words can do it or could ever do it.
Even if I were to tirelessly repeat the various ways, until the very last star in the universe flickered and faded and the final black hole has ceased to exist, it wouldn't be enough.

What I can say is this: you are incredible, awesome, beautiful, loving, caring...perfect.

Maybe not perfect perfect no one is no one will be. But you are perfect for me. And you are the closest to Perfection. You are the most loving a human ever could be. 

I love you.
