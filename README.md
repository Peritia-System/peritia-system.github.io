## Crediting
### This entire Page is based on the awesome work of [HynDuf](https://hynduf.github.io/)! 
Regarding CSS and general design it is all their work please check out their Work!!!

Regarding the base design please Visit:  [Huxpro's Jekyll](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io) 
I really didn't do much and just made HynDuf's work more fit my needs. thats it.

‚ö†Ô∏è  Note: Much of the code was added on the fly, so it may appear somewhat messy. I am **not** planning to clean it up in the future.

## Customize
Since none is actually my work and i really just used it for my personal blog please visit [Hux Blog](https://github.com/Huxpro/huxpro.github.io) for the base desing.
